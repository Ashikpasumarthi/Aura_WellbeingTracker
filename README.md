Aura - AI Wellness Companion (Hybrid Cloud Edition)Combat digital burnout with a privacy-first, AI-powered wellness coach that follows you everywhere.(Replace this placeholder with your "Aura Hybrid Architecture" diagram or a screenshot of the extension) Core PurposeAura is a hybrid wellness ecosystem designed to combat digital burnout in remote workforces without compromising employee privacy.Traditional wellness tools are limited to single-device timers. Aura bridges this gap by combining:Local Privacy: A Chrome Extension using Built-in AI (Gemini Nano) for real-time, offline interventions.Cloud Intelligence: A Google Cloud Run backend with Vertex AI (Gemini Pro) for long-term trend analysis and cross-device synchronization. Key Features Smart Budgeting (Local AI): Instead of a generic timer, Aura uses the Prompt API (Gemini Nano) locally to calculate a personalized screen time budget based on your age, shift, and activity level.Unique Interventions (Writer API): When you hit your limit, Aura doesn't just say "Stop." It uses the Writer API to generate a unique, encouraging wellness tip (stretch, hydration, mindfulness) every single time.☁️ Cloud Sync (Cloud Run + Firestore): Your focus sessions are automatically synced to a secure cloud database, allowing you to track your wellness trends across multiple devices.📈 Deep Insights (Vertex AI): The cloud backend uses Gemini Pro to analyze your weekly work history and generate deep, psychological insights to prevent burnout before it happens. Hybrid ArchitectureThis project implements a sophisticated Hybrid AI Architecture spanning the Client and the Cloud.1. The Edge Sensor Layer (Chrome Extension)Technology: Manifest V3, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.Role: Handles real-time tracking and immediate interventions.Key Components:background.js: Service Worker for time tracking and event handling.offscreen.js: Hidden document to run Built-in AI tasks (Prompt/Writer APIs).AI Model: Gemini Nano (on-device).2. The Cloud Orchestration Layer (Google Cloud Run)Technology: Node.js (Express), Docker, Google Cloud Run.Role: API Gateway and Intelligence Hub.Key Functions:/api/sync-profile: Saves user preferences./api/sync-session: Logs completed focus sessions./api/generate-insight: Calls Vertex AI to analyze history.3. The Persistence & Intelligence LayerDatabase: Google Cloud Firestore (NoSQL) for storing user profiles and session logs.Advanced AI: Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) for batch analysis of long-term data.🛠️ Technology StackComponentTech UsedPurposeFrontendChrome Extension (JS)User Interface & Local TrackingLocal AIGemini NanoReal-time, offline budgets & tipsBackendNode.js / ExpressAPI ServerHostingGoogle Cloud RunServerless DeploymentDatabaseFirestoreData PersistenceCloud AIVertex AILong-term pattern analysis⚙️ Installation & Testing GuidePrerequisitesChrome Canary (Version 128+ required for Built-in AI).Flag Enabled: Go to chrome://flags and enable prompt-api-for-gemini-nano.Google Cloud Project: With Cloud Run and Vertex AI APIs enabled.1.
