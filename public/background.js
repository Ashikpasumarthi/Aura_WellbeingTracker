//this file is more often like a watchman whose primary task is guard the house and they are not involved in the day to day activities within the house.
//The guard is always on duty, even when the office workers have closed their doors and gone home (it runs in the background even when your UI is closed).
//The guard doesn't do anything until a specific event happensâ€”a fire alarm goes off, a delivery arrives, a door opens. They react to events.

//we need this file for persistence, unlike any react js scripts which are ephemeral and get destroyed when the UI is closed.But background.js is persistent and always running in the background.
// So if you need to maintain state or perform tasks that should continue even when the user isn't actively interacting with your extension, background.js is the place to do it.
//The service worker is needed because it lives independently. It's the browser's way of giving your extension a place to run important logic that must continue working no matter what the user is doing.
//In summary, you need the service worker because it's the only part of your extension that is always on-duty, allowing you to reliably run your timer and notification logic in the background.

//what it does?
//Event Handling: This is its most important job in your extension. It constantly listens for browser events and runs code when they happen. For your project, it will listen for:

// A tab being activated (chrome.tabs.onActivated)

// The user going idle (chrome.idle.onStateChanged)

// A pre-set alarm going off (chrome.alarms.onAlarm)








// Read, modify, write pattern
// That's an excellent question, and the good news is that the "Read, Modify, Write" pattern handles this situation perfectly.

// If it's a fresh start and no other data exists, the `allData` variable inside your `get` callback will simply be an **empty object (`{}`).**

// -----

// ## The "Fresh Start" Example

// Let's walk through the process for the very first tab ever created.

// ### 1\. Read

// You call **`chrome.storage.local.get(null, (allData) => { ... })`**.

//   * Because storage is empty, the `allData` variable inside your callback is now just `{}`.

// ### 2\. Modify

// Your code then adds the new tab's information to this empty object.

//   * `allData[tabId] = { ... };`
//   * `allData.lastActiveTabId = tabId;`

// Now, your `allData` variable looks like this:

// ```javascript
// {
//   "123": { "timeSpent": 0, "lastActivated": 1664884200000 },
//   "lastActiveTabId": "123"
// }
// ```

// ### 3\. Write

// Finally, you call **`chrome.storage.local.set(allData)`**, which saves this new object to storage.

// So, the logic works exactly the same. Adding a new property to an empty object is a standard operation, which means your current code already handles a fresh start without any changes.
